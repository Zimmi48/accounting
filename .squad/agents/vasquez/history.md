# Project Context

- **Owner:** Théo Zimmermann
- **Project:** accounting
- **Stack:** Elm, Lamdera, elm-ui, elm-review, elm-format
- **Description:** Group expense and accounting app where shared model changes can break frontend and backend together.
- **Created:** 2026-04-19

## Learnings

- 2026-05-05: The mixed-sign spending regression lives in `src/Backend.elm` validation, not the dialog submit path: `normalizeSpendingTransactions` and `isBalancedTransaction` must preserve non-zero negative amounts so cases like total 100 with creditors `200` and `-100` survive, and `tests/BackendTests.elm` now guards that exact backend seam.
- 2026-04-28: Regression coverage in `tests/BackendTests.elm` now replays active transactions to compare exact stored `totalGroupCredits` snapshots against recomputation at global/year/month/day scope; current failures show `src/Backend.elm` edit/delete flows leave zero-valued group entries and empty period buckets behind after `removeTransactionFromModel`, while `groupTransactionForList` and `spendingTransactionsForDetails` still correctly expose only the active replacement rows.
- 2026-04-27: Review of the backend cleanup + group-ordering pass confirmed `src/Backend.elm` still needs `PendingTransaction` because it carries staging-only `year`/`month`/`day` fields into `assignTransactionIds` and the year/month/day storage buckets, while stored `Transaction` records no longer persist those fields; `getSpendingTransactions` is gone, but `src/Frontend.elm` now reverses a backend `RequestGroupTransactions` list that is already produced newest-first via nested `Dict.foldr`, and the added frontend test only proves a synthetic `List.reverse` helper instead of the real backend/frontend ordering seam.

- 2026-04-27: Dallas's follow-up revision restores `Spending.transactionIds` in `src/Types.elm` and `src/Codecs.elm`, and `src/Backend.elm` now recovers a spending's transactions through that stored id list plus `findTransaction` instead of `allTransactionsWithIds model |> List.filter`; validation passed with codec check, both Lamdera builds, `npm test`, and an HTTP 200 probe on the already-running local server.

- 2026-04-27: Reviewing the current transaction-identity refactor showed the repo state still removes `Spending.transactionIds` from `src/Types.elm`/`src/Codecs.elm` and recovers spending transactions by `allTransactionsWithIds model |> List.filter (\( _, transaction ) -> transaction.spendingId == spendingId)` in `src/Backend.elm`; tests/compiles can pass while this requirement still regresses.

- 2026-04-26: Widened the compact per-line field to 200px to ensure full ISO date visibility in transaction details (branch: squad/review/vasquez-fix-date-width).

- Initial roster assignment: Tester and reviewer for risky cross-cutting changes.
- 2026-04-22: Final UI review for PR #39 / commit `ae26ce6` confirmed the fix belongs in `normalizeSpendingDialogLines` in `src/Frontend.elm`: passive row normalization must not seed opposite-side amounts, while compact row alignment needs width constraints on the outer labeled blocks, not just the inner controls.
- 2026-04-21: Hicks's spending editor follow-up polish in `src/Frontend.elm` keeps the approved contract intact while restoring labeled group fields (`Debitor 1` / `Creditor 1`), using inline SVG icon controls, and rendering revealed per-line details as Description before Date.
- 2026-04-21: The ready-row/auto-grow/collapse seam is enforced by `normalizeSpendingDialogLines` and `normalizeTransactionLines` in `src/Frontend.elm`, which prune blank extras and keep one trailing placeholder row per debitor/creditor list.
- 2026-04-22: PR #39 / commit `5eab7a5` keeps the editor contract intact while splitting spending-total edits onto `normalizeSpendingDialogTotal` so total changes stop re-autofilling line amounts, and reuses `transactionLineFlexibleFieldWidth` plus `transactionLineCompactFieldWidth` to keep primary/detail rows on the same width contract across breakpoints in `src/Frontend.elm`.

- 2026-04-28: Test failure investigation identified `getSpendingTransactionsWithIds` filtering out non-Active transactions. Filter removed to include all statuses. All 15 elm tests passing after fix.

- 2026-04-28: Evergreen work is now explicitly authorized, and the workspace already contains untracked auto-generated `src/Evergreen/V26/` plus `src/Evergreen/Migrate/V26.elm` from a `lamdera check --force` pass. The migration surface is still the big V24 → V26 model jump (singleton transaction dialog/history to spending+transaction split), and `src/Evergreen/Migrate/V26.elm` currently carries 39 `Unimplemented` placeholders, so review must treat the first commit as pure generated artifacts and the follow-up commit as all semantic migration logic.

- 2026-04-28: Reviewer focus for Evergreen in this repo is the persistence seam, not compile success: `src/Evergreen/V24/Types.elm` still stores per-day `Day.spendings : List Spending`, transaction-addressed dialogs/messages, and no top-level `BackendModel.spendings`, while `src/Evergreen/V26/Types.elm` / `src/Types.elm` expect append-only `BackendModel.spendings : Array Spending`, `Day.transactions : Array Transaction`, `Spending.transactionIds`, `SpendingReference`, and spending-scoped dialogs/messages.

- 2026-04-28: Current validation baseline is green before any manual migration edits: `lamdera --version` = `0.19.1`, `npm test` passes (15 tests), `./check-codecs.sh` passes, and both `lamdera make src/Frontend.elm --output=/dev/null` and `lamdera make src/Backend.elm --output=/dev/null` succeed. Key reviewer file paths for this migration window are `src/Evergreen/Migrate/V26.elm`, `src/Evergreen/V24/Types.elm`, `src/Evergreen/V26/Types.elm`, `src/Types.elm`, `src/Backend.elm`, and `tests/{BackendTests,CodecsTests,FrontendTests}.elm`.
 
- 2026-04-28: Hudson's `scripts/compare_exports.py` proves storage-level parity (`logical_spendings`, totals, integrity warnings), but it does **not** reconstruct the production `RequestGroupTransactions` seam in `src/Backend.elm`; reviewer coverage for group listings still needs a direct per-group active-transaction derivation or endpoint-level regression because `groupTransactionForList` owns active filtering, credit/debit share sign, and description stitching. Validation on this review pass: `lamdera --version` = `0.19.1`, both `lamdera make` targets succeed, and `npm test` passes (27 tests).

## Core Context

**Spending/Transaction Model (Phase 2 Contract):**
- Spending is the edited unit; transactions are immutable line items
- Spending-level invariant enforced in backend: `total credits = total debits = spending.total`
- Each transaction line owns its own (year, month, day) and optional secondaryDescription
- Spending date used only as UI default seed for new lines
- SpendingTransaction remains ID-free in wire format; backend assigns TransactionId after insertion
- Codec parity check (`./check-codecs.sh`) required alongside compile health as release gate
- No Evergreen migration generated; deferred pending user model review

**Spending Dialog Contract (UI Refinement):**
- Ready first row + one auto-growing trailing placeholder row per debitor/creditor list
- Empty extra rows collapse when fully cleared
- Compact icon-only controls: ▸/▾ for details toggle, × for remove
- Row labels are inline group fields (`Debitor 1`, `Creditor 1`, etc.)
- Details (Date + Description) hidden by default; auto-reveal when secondary description non-empty OR line date differs from spending date
- Details render Description before Date when revealed
- Debitors render before creditors
- Desktop: one flexible field + one 150px compact field
- Small screens: paired fields split available width evenly
- Spending total edits treated as parent-level changes; do not auto-fill debit/credit line amounts
- Outer `el` wrapper owns width contract; inner Input/DatePicker use `width fill` for alignment reliability

**Validation gates (all passing):**
- `elm-format --validate src/` ✅
- `./check-codecs.sh` ✅
- `lamdera make src/Frontend.elm --output=/dev/null` ✅
- `lamdera make src/Backend.elm --output=/dev/null` ✅
- `lamdera live` → HTTP 200 ✅

**Key files:**
- `src/Types.elm`: SpendingTransaction (ID-free), Spending (with total), Transaction (dated, optional secondary description)
- `src/Backend.elm`: validateSpendingTransactions (spending-level invariant only)
- `src/Frontend.elm`: normalizeSpendingDialogLines, normalizeTransactionLinesWithoutAutofill, transactionLineDetailsVisible, addSpendingInputs, width layout contracts

## Summarized Context (2026-04-22 through 2026-04-27T12:14)

**UI Seam & Validation Evolution:**
- 2026-04-22T17:04:59Z: Final UI fixes approved (PR #39). Both regression fixes confirmed: normalizeTransactionLinesWithoutAutofill prevents opposite-side seeding, outer `el` width contract aligns date/field blocks.
- Elm test harness initialized with `elm-test init --compiler "$(which lamdera)"` and integrated into CI. Suite covers transaction invariants, dialog logic, codec parity (13 tests, all passing).
- Validator gate requirement locked: `elm-format --validate src/` + `./check-codecs.sh` required as release checks alongside compile health.
- No Evergreen migration files generated throughout Phase 2 (deferred pending user model review).

**Backend/Model Refactor Rejection Cycle:**
- **Cycle 1 (Bishop, 2026-04-27T11:47:00Z):** Incomplete Evergreen migration (`src/Evergreen/Migrate/V26.elm` contains Unimplemented placeholders). Rejected; Bishop locked out.
- **Cycle 2 (Newt, 2026-04-27T12:04:51Z):** Append-only positional-transaction logic internally correct and validation passes, but removes persisted codec shapes (`BackendModel.nextSpendingId`, `Spending.transactionIds`, `Transaction.id`) without migration support. Under no-migration rule, rejected; Newt locked out.
- **Cycle 3 (Dallas, 2026-04-27T12:16:40Z):** Same backend logic coherence, validation still passes, but persisted codec shapes still changed without authorized migration. Rejected under no-migration constraint; Dallas locked out.
- **Recovery (Hudson, 2026-04-27T12:17:00Z):** Fixed same-day drift by appending in `addTransactionToDay`, preserved persisted shapes (all IDs remain), validation passed, compatibility safe. **APPROVED.** Session deemed complete.

**Clarified Direction (2026-04-27T13:18:29Z):**
- User directive: Codec compatibility no longer required; codecs just match new model. Evergreen generation still deferred until explicit user request.
- Impact: Enables stripped refactor (Array storage, no persisted IDs) without legacycompatibility layer.

**New Approval (2026-04-27T13:38:00Z):**
- Dallas array refactor under clarified rule: `BackendModel.spendings : Array Spending`, `Day.transactions : Array Transaction`, all persisted IDs removed, codecs regenerated (no legacy fields), `src/Backend.elm` appends with `Array.push` and derives IDs from array position, membership via `transaction.spendingId`. Evergreen untouched. Validation: formatting, codecs, both `lamdera make`, `npm test` (13/13), HTTP 200. **APPROVED.**

### 2026-04-22T17:04:59Z: Final UI Seam Fixes Approved

- Reviewed Hicks commit `ae26ce6` on `squad-model-change` / PR #39 for final UI seam fixes
- Confirmed both fixes present:
  1. Row editing no longer seeds opposite-side amounts via `normalizeTransactionLinesWithoutAutofill`
  2. Date/field block width now matches amount/field block width via outer `el` width contract
- Full regression sweep verified: ready first row, trailing placeholder, empty-row collapse, icon controls, debitors-before-creditors, inline labels, hidden details by default, description-before-date, spending-level invariant, line-level ownership all intact
- **Team outcome:** All regressions passed; PR #39 approved and ready for merge

## Learnings

[Summarized into Summarized Context above.]

## 2026-04-27T11:47:00Z: Test Suite Delivery Complete

**Event:** Test harness accepted and integrated into CI.

**Delivered:**
- 13 elm-test cases covering transaction invariants, dialog logic, codec parity
- npm test runner integrated into CI
- README updated with test instructions
- Squad agent docs updated

**Reviewer verdict:** Bishop's backend/model refactor rejected due to incomplete src/Evergreen/Migrate/V26.elm. Newt assigned to complete.

**Status:** Vasquez role (Tester) validation cycle complete for this delivery.

## 2026-04-27T12:04:51Z through 2026-04-27T13:38:00Z: Refactor Cycle Complete

[Detailed rejection cycle and final approval condensed into Summarized Context above. Key outcome: Dallas array refactor now approved under clarified codec compatibility rule.]

## 2026-04-27: Array Refactor Final Review & Approval

✅ Approved Dallas Array refactor:
- Validated codec shape matches new model
- Confirmed Evergreen untouched
- All gates passed: formatting, codecs, compile, tests, HTTP 200
- Clarified codec compatibility rule applied (no legacy required)

Status: Ready for next phase.

## 2026-04-27T14:39:52Z: Review Cycle 4 — Hudson Rejection & Dallas Reassignment

**Event:** Reviewed Hudson's `Spending.transactionIds` restoration attempt.

**Verdict:** Reject current repo state.

**Reason:** Workspace does not contain the required model property or backend implementation:
- `src/Types.elm`: No `transactionIds` field on `Spending`
- `src/Codecs.elm`: Does not serialize `transactionIds`
- `src/Backend.elm`: Recovers spending transactions via `allTransactionsWithIds model |> List.filter` (whole-model scan still present)

**Validation observed:** Despite all gates passing (format, codecs, compile, tests, HTTP 200), the user requirement is not satisfied. Tests and validation alone are insufficient; repo state must align with directive.

**Action:** Hudson locked out; Dallas assigned to next attempt.

**Key insight for next owner:** The test suite does not catch missing model properties. The codecs check passes because the codec matches the (incomplete) model. Validator diligence requires checking both workspace alignment with directives AND gate success.

## 2026-04-27T14:49:39Z: Final Review — Dallas Restoration APPROVED

**Event:** Reviewed Dallas's `Spending.transactionIds` restoration implementation.

**Verdict:** Approve. All requirements satisfied.

**What was fixed:**
- ✅ `src/Types.elm`: `Spending.transactionIds : List TransactionId` restored
- ✅ `src/Codecs.elm`: Field serialization aligned
- ✅ `src/Backend.elm`: Recovery uses direct `findTransaction` lookup on stored ids, not `allTransactionsWithIds |> filter`
- ✅ Defensive `transaction.spendingId == spendingId` check retained

**Validation:**
- ✅ `elm-format --validate src/ tests/`
- ✅ `./check-codecs.sh`
- ✅ `lamdera make src/Frontend.elm --output=/dev/null`
- ✅ `lamdera make src/Backend.elm --output=/dev/null`
- ✅ `npm test` (13/13 passing)
- ✅ HTTP 200 on `http://localhost:8000` (existing local server)

**Consequence:** Regression closed. `Spending.transactionIds` is required and persisted; whole-model transaction scans for spending recovery are removed.

**Consequence:** Regression closed. `Spending.transactionIds` is required and persisted; whole-model transaction scans for spending recovery are removed.

**Status:** Complete and committed.

## 2026-04-27T15:52:08Z: Split Verdict on Backend Cleanup + Ordering

**Event:** Review of Dallas's dual-commit backend pass.

**Verdict:** Approved cleanup; rejected ordering/test for reassignment.

### Cleanup Approval ✅
- `PendingTransaction` kept (still carries staging date fields)
- `getSpendingTransactions` dead helper removed
- Backend cleanup is safe and complete

### Ordering Rejection ❌
**Reason:** Not proven safe; likely inverts already-newest-first flow.
- `RequestGroupTransactions` via nested `Dict.foldr` already yields newest-first
- Frontend reversal likely flips back to older-first display
- Test only covers synthetic `List.reverse`, not real backend/frontend seam
- Same-day ordering not protected

**Reassignment:** Hudson assigned to ordering revision with corrected seam testing.

**Status:** Review complete. Follow-up assigned to Hudson.

- 2026-04-27T16:02:33Z (Scribe orchestration): Vasquez rejection completed. Decision inbox merged; Hudson locked out for artifact (standing policy); Hicks assigned as next owner. Orchestration logs written; team updates appended to affected agent histories.

- 2026-04-27T16:22:00Z (Hicks ordering review): APPROVED. `groupTransactionsFromBackend` in `src/Frontend.elm` now contains `List.reverse responseTransactions`. Regression test in `tests/FrontendTests.elm` uses realistic ascending input (Apr 16 → Apr 17 → Apr 18 idx=1 → Apr 18 idx=2) and asserts newest-first output including same-day ordering (idx=2 before idx=1). Backend `allTransactionsWithIds` confirmed still emitting oldest-first via `Dict.foldr ++ acc`. All 15 tests pass. Seam contract fully restored.

### 2026-04-27T16:22:00Z: Hicks Transaction Ordering — APPROVED ✅

**Artifact:** reverse-transaction-order (Hicks revision)  
**Verdict:** APPROVED — No further revision required  

**Verification Summary:**
- ✅ Frontend consumer seam: `groupTransactionsFromBackend` restores `List.reverse responseTransactions` at correct boundary
- ✅ Backend emission order: `allTransactionsWithIds` confirmed ascending (oldest-first) via nested `Dict.foldr ++ acc` pattern
- ✅ Test quality: Upgraded from synthetic to realistic — feeds ascending backend response, asserts newest-first consumption, covers same-day ordering
- ✅ Validation gates: elm-format, both lamdera make targets, npm test (15/15 passing), HTTP 200
- ✅ Regression coverage: Multi-day ordering, same-day index ordering, group isolation

**Status:** Complete. Ready for merge. Orchestration record: `.squad/orchestration-log/20260427-161057-vasquez-review-hicks-ordering.md`

- 2026-04-27T16:22:00Z (Hicks ordering review): APPROVED. `groupTransactionsFromBackend` in `src/Frontend.elm` now contains `List.reverse responseTransactions`. Regression test in `tests/FrontendTests.elm` uses realistic ascending input (Apr 16 → Apr 17 → Apr 18 idx=1 → Apr 18 idx=2) and asserts newest-first output including same-day ordering (idx=2 before idx=1). Backend `allTransactionsWithIds` confirmed still emitting oldest-first via `Dict.foldr ++ acc`. All 15 tests pass. Seam contract fully restored.

## 2026-04-27T17:xx: Test Regression — Transaction Status Filter Fix

**Incident:** Two tests failing in `BackendTests.elm`:
- `editing a spending keeps the replaced slots stable and appends the replacement rows` 
- `deleting a spending keeps its historical slots while hiding it from active detail views`

**Root cause:** `getSpendingTransactionsWithIds` in `src/Backend.elm` was filtering to only return transactions with `status == Active`. This violated the append-only invariant: when tests marked old transactions as `Replaced` or `Deleted` via `setTransactionStatuses`, those status changes became invisible to callers. The tests expect `getSpendingTransactionsWithIds` to return all transactions in a spending's `transactionIds` list, preserving their statuses for historical inspection.

**Fix applied:** Removed the `transaction.status == Active` filter from `getSpendingTransactionsWithIds` (line 964). Now the function returns all transactions regardless of status, making status mutations visible and restoring the immutability contract: old slots stay stable and visible with their updated status markers.

**Validation:** 
- ✅ npm test: 15/15 passing
- ✅ elm-format --validate: pass
- ✅ ./check-codecs.sh: up to date
- ✅ lamdera make (both Frontend and Backend): Success

**Impact:** Spending edit/delete workflows now properly track historical transaction slots via status markers, enabling audit trails and protecting against accidental reuse of old slots.

## 2026-04-28: Evergreen V24→V26 migration review completed

**Session:** Evergreen migration preparation
**Partner Agent:** Ripley (strategy + execution)

Reviewed and validated Evergreen migration artifacts. Confirmed:

**Regression risk assessment:**
1. ✅ Backend accounting history preserved (no empty arrays)
2. ✅ Spending-transaction membership reconstructed correctly
3. ✅ Historical status/audit data retained (append-only discipline)
4. ✅ Frontend state safely reset where ID mapping cannot be reconstructed
5. ✅ Two-commit workflow maintained (generated + manual separation)

**Validation checklist passed:**
- ✅ No `Unimplemented` placeholders remain
- ✅ Commit boundaries clean (no mixing of generated + manual)
- ✅ All repo checks green (tests, codecs, Frontend, Backend)
- ✅ Post-edit `lamdera check --force` confirmed Evergreen coherence

**Outcome:** Migration approved for production. All rejection criteria satisfied. Ready for deploy.

- 2026-04-28: Migration regression coverage now lives in `tests/MigrationTests.elm` plus `tests/FrontendTests.elm`: backend fixtures should assert reconstructed `BackendModel.spendings`, per-day `Day.transactions`, `Spending.transactionIds`, transaction statuses, and copied credit totals from `src/Evergreen/Migrate/V26.elm`; frontend safety is best proven at exposed dialog/message migration boundaries (`migrateFrontendDialog`, `migrateFrontendMsg`, `migrateToBackend`, `migrateToFrontend`) because old `FrontendModel` contains an opaque navigation key that is awkward to construct in pure tests.

## 2026-04-28T09:40:39Z: Migration Test Coverage Expansion — Backend + Frontend Safety

**Event:** Assigned as tester for extensive migration coverage; Dallas confirmed frontend safety.

**Context:** User directive requires backend migration extensively tested and frontend migration to avoid confusing stale IDs; acceptable to reset state.

**Execution:**

### Backend Migration Tests
Added comprehensive `tests/MigrationTests.elm` coverage for V24→V26:
- Spendings reconstruction from V24 per-day storage to V26 top-level array
- Transaction membership: per-day `Day.transactions` array construction
- Membership links: `Spending.transactionIds` list alignment with migrated transactions
- Status propagation: Historical `Deleted`/`Replaced` statuses survive migration
- Metadata preservation: Transaction line dates, descriptions, amounts
- Totals correctness: Spending total and per-line credits/debits preserved

### Frontend Test Assertions  
Updated `tests/FrontendTests.elm` to require stale-ID safety patterns:
- `migrateFrontendDialog`: Legacy edit dialogs must drop (not preserve)
- `migrateFrontendMsg`: Legacy edit/delete/detail messages convert to no-ops
- `migrateToBackend`/`migrateToFrontend`: Stale references handled safely

**Decision:** Test contract locked: transaction-addressed UI state unsafe to preserve; must reset or no-op.

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Backend migration tests: Comprehensive coverage for all data structures
- ✅ Frontend tests: Stale-ID safety assertions in place
- ✅ Decision doc: Test contract for future migration work
- ✅ Validation: Repo passing (tests, codecs, Frontend, Backend)

**Status:** Complete. Ready for code review. Migration test infrastructure established for future releases.

- 2026-04-28: Re-review of Dallas's `scripts/compare_exports.py` revision approves the group-listing seam coverage. The script now mirrors `src/Backend.elm` `groupTransactionForList` plus `src/Frontend.elm` `groupTransactionsFromBackend`: it filters to active transactions with active spendings, composes descriptions with trimmed secondary descriptions, renders credit shares negative / debit shares positive via the same amount formatting, and reverses each per-group list to newest-first (including same-day index order). Key review files: `scripts/compare_exports.py`, `src/Backend.elm`, `src/Frontend.elm`, `README.md`.

## 2026-04-28: Group Transaction Diff Review - Migration Safety Gate

**Event:** Reviewed group transaction diff export tool for migration-safety seams.

**Cycle 1 - First Review (Hudson):**
- Rejected: Script compared storage-level facts but did not replay `RequestGroupTransactions` seam
- Missing backend active filtering, frontend rendering, and ordering semantics
- Established requirement: direct per-group active transaction multiset comparison

**Cycle 2 - Re-Review (Dallas):**
- Approved: Revised implementation replays real seam
- Active filtering matches `src/Backend.elm` `groupTransactionForList`
- Credit/debit sign rendering matches app listing contract
- Description composition matches `transactionDescription` logic
- Per-group ordering matches real seam (backend traversal → bucket → frontend newest-first)

**Key learning:** Migration safety evidence must include user-facing seams, not just storage parity. Export diff now covers both logical spendings + group-list rendering semantics.

## 2026-04-28: Total Replay Regression Test Coverage Added

- Implemented 3 comprehensive regression test cases in `tests/BackendTests.elm`
- All fail on current codebase (2 of 30 tests fail)
- Tests confirm exact aggregate replay as required invariant
- Isolated defect to `removeTransactionFromModel` (active-row filtering layer works correctly)
- Decision merged into `.squad/decisions.md` with Ripley's root cause analysis
- Test failures now provide specification for backend remediation

## 2026-05-05T19:49:26Z: Mixed-sign Spending Regression Verification (Background)

- **Task:** Verify and review Bishop's fix for mixed-sign creditor spending regression
- **Reproduction:** Manually confirmed regression in live app: spending dialog rejects balanced mixed-sign creditor amounts with validation error "Spending total must match total credits and total debits"
- **Bishop's Fix Review:** Examined changes to `src/Backend.elm` validation and `tests/BackendTests.elm` regression test
- **Verification Scope:** Approved scenario: total 100 with creditors [200, -100] must succeed after fix
- **Validation:**
  - Reproduced original failure on reverted backend
  - Verified fix resolves the regression on restored backend
  - Confirmed all validation gates: elm-format, check-codecs.sh, both lamdera make targets, npm test, lamdera live HTTP 200
- **Verdict:** ✓ Approved for merge
- **Decision merged:** Mixed-sign spending validation (2026-05-05)
- **Status:** Completed
